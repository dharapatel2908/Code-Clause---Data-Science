## TASK-1 Wine Quality Prediction
In this project, we aim to predict the quality of wine based on a set of fundamental features that influence its overall quality. To achieve this, we will utilize the wine quality dataset freely available on the Internet. The dataset contains crucial attributes that play a significant role in determining the wine's quality.
## TASK-2 Stock Market Prediction
Stock market prediction is a complex endeavor aiming to anticipate the future value of a specific stock, an entire sector, or the overall market. Predictions are typically based on fundamental analysis, which involves evaluating a company's financial health and economic factors affecting the market. Technical analysis is also used, which involves studying historical price charts and patterns. Often, a combination of both fundamental and technical analysis is employed to make more accurate forecasts.
